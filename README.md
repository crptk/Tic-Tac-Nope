# tic-tac-toe-game
My first programming project, created without the use of Youtube tutorials and with the help of ChatGPT when it comes to CSS layout, Javascript syntax and optimization.  Learned a bit about layout design with CSS, but I especially learned a lot about Javascript as this was a great introduction for me.

I'm not sure who'll see this, maybe myself in the future as I look back on my previous projects, someone else who's new looking for inspiration to start, or maybe some super experienced programming laughing at my old projects! Haha, I hope I can get far in the programming space.
