# Tic-Tac-Toe Game By Edrees (edx) / Crptk (github)
####Video demo: 
####Description: My first programming project as well as my final CS50 project, created without the use of Youtube tutorials and with the help of ChatGPT when it comes to CSS layout, as well as Javascript syntax and optimization. 
                 I used the skills I learned from Week 8 especially, mostly with the CSS and HTML, but I especially learned a lot about Javascript as that was a big struggle for me during the course.

                Later in the future, I want to add onto this project by learning how to use NodeJS to create a login system, as well as MongoDB for the database of users so I can create a global match history system, and maybe
                a way to queue others online.
